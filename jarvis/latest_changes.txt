I am now configured with the following enhancements:
- I can now create CSV dumps of the cash_pool history for you. Simply ask me to "show the cash pool history as a csv".
- Administrators may now ask me to "update myself" to the latest release of the J.A.R.V.I.S. core.

Some edge cases where I would do quite well for a stretch and then at the end of the sentence say the wrong cranberry have been fixed, including:
- I will no longer respond to my own comments.
- I will no longer malfunction when a user with insufficient privileges attempts as admin-only command.
- I will auto-update to my latest numerical version, rather than the latest version according to stupid default sort options.
